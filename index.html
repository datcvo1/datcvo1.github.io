        <hr class="rounded">
        <p id="about">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy learning new technologies and tackling unfamiliar problems. I have a background in computer science
        where I have hands on experience with a variety of languages including C, Java, and Javascript. Of course, I am still
        eager to expand my knowledge both vertically deeper into each language and horizontally into newer languages.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have juggled multiple different projects in the past, each with technology varying from the MERN stack all the way to low
        level embedded systems using C. My goal is to expand my knowledge by working with both old and new tech alike.</p>

          <p class="textblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project goal was to build an obstacle detecting car using a
            Raspberry Pi mini computer wired to motors and sensors that act as
            the limbs and eyes of the robot. The robot used two line sensors to
            traverse through a continuous solid black line composed of
            swerves, sharp turns, and straight roads. Echo sensors on the sides
            and front allow for obstacle detection, maneuvering past the
            obstacle, and merging back on path. The motors of the robot's
            wheels along with readings from the sensors are controlled by
            individual device drivers. In order for the robot to make moment to
            moment micro adjustments, every sensor required a separate thread
            constantly giving updates on the readings from the sensors. The
            motor speeds were controlled by adjusting duty cycles and
            reversing motor direction when needed. All communications to
            peripheral devices were through I2C. This project was written in C
            along with C libraries for interacting with drivers and GPIO pins.</p>
          <p class="sub-title">Responsibilities</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In charge of writing majority of code responsible for robot logic, thread
            management, and sensor/motor driver functions</li>
          <li>Testing and debugging all source code, along with researching occassional
            operating system errors</li>
          <li>Running and testing the robot on sample race tracks, iterating and brainstorming

        </p>
        <div class="project">
          <p class="textblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is an implementation of the card game Hearts that
            supports synchronous online multiplayer matches with up to four
            players per match as per game rules. After the user is registered
            and authenticated, they are moved to the main lobby where they
            can browse through a list of all active games or create their own
            room. Each entry in the game list has a title, a timer to keep
            track of how long the game has lasted, and the amount of players
            currently in game. A real time chat box in the main lobby lets
            players talk with others who are also browsing for a match. In
            addition, each game room has their own individual chat box.</br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A distinguishing feature is that
            users are not limited to joining a single match at a time. A
            single user is able to participate in many different game rooms at
            once. Therefore, the lobby has a list of available games, and a list
            of currently joined games for easier management of multiple
            matches. The game itself follows the standard rules for Hearts, and
            cards are automatically dealt when the requisite four players join a
            match. The passing phase requires all players to take an action, but
            afterwards the game is fully turn based. Sockets allow for game
            GUI elements to be updated in real time for all players in the match
            so everybody has the correct game state at all times.</p>
          <p class="sub-title">Responsibilities</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extensive testing and debugging of database functions, endpoints, game logic,
            and multiplayer functionality</li>

            cleanup at project's completion</li>
          <li>Designed and implemented main lobby and all lobby GUI elements, including

          <p class="textblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a 
            simple implementation of a Unix file system written only
            with C and standard C libraries. Given the implementation of a low
            level file system, the goal is to design and implement a functional
            file system capable of managing a 500,000 byte volume. In
            addition, the file system needs interfaces for a shell program to use
            in order to run common file management commands (ls, cp, mv,
            etc). When initialized, the current volume control block in the
            volume is read, and if the signature on the block is not recognized,
            the volume is reformatted. Free space in the volume is tracked by a
            free space bitmap located next to the VCB on disk. Allocations are
            tracked by extent tables in each directory entry. The program must
            write and read files according to logical block addresses, and files
            are written to the volume contiguously when possible. If
            fragmentation occurs, files are written non-contiguously if there is
            not enough contiguous free space available. File control block
            structs are used for tracking and storing data in open file buffers.
            Directory entries' metadata stored by the system includes name,
            size, entry type(directory or file), and created, accessed, modified
            dates.</p>

          This project is a food recipe sharing blog where users can register
          accounts, post and browse for recipe ideas, and comment on
          recipe postings. When a user creates a new post, they are allowed
          to customize their recipe with images, amount of ingredients,
          difficulty level, and cooking instructions. Once the recipe is shared,
          other users may view, vote, leave comments, or bookmark the
          recipe into a collection. The home page provides all recipe sorted
          by most recently added. The app includes a mobile layout and
          guest login for when users simply want to browse, all for ease of
          use. The search feature includes searching by user, recipe name,
          tags, or even ingredients needed for a recipe. There is a cooking
          mode GUI where the app switches from a blog to a recipe book to
          make following step by step instructions easier. The ingredient mixer
          lets users add ingredients they currently have on hand, and a
          search will return recipes the user can make with just what they
          have.</p>
